# CalendarSyncUtil - For OutLook Windows

## What is it?
A silly little calendar sync utility I wrote. It helps me keep multiple calendars in sync. 

## Some Notes

Masked Target - This means that when your target calendar is synchronized the times are set; but the details, and subject are set to BLOCK; and the appointment is set to private.

### To get started

1. Install it (setup.exe) (Releases)
2. Open Outlook (or re-open it)
3. Click Sync Settings in your Home Ribbon Tab
4. Add your source and targets, set your mask option
5. Whenever you want, click sync. 
Note: If you sync without cached mode, your sync may freeze. At some point I'll thread this.
